# Tool-Studies: Wireshark 
## Purpose
Wireshark is a powerful tool for network & security engineers, and there are several reasons why you should learn it:

- Network troubleshooting: As a network security engineer, you may need to troubleshoot network issues. Wireshark allows you to capture and analyze packets, which can help you identify the root cause of the problem.

- Network security: Wireshark can also be used for network security purposes. You can use it to identify potential security threats, such as malicious traffic or network attacks. Additionally, you can use Wireshark to analyze network traffic for compliance with security policies.

- Packet analysis: Wireshark allows you to analyze packets at a very granular level. This can be useful for understanding how different protocols work, how data is transmitted over the network, and how packets are structured.

- Network optimization: Wireshark can also be used to optimize network performance. By analyzing network traffic, you can identify bottlenecks and other issues that may be affecting network performance.

- Forensics: Finally, Wireshark can be used for network forensics. If a security incident occurs, you can use Wireshark to capture and analyze packets to identify what happened and how the incident occurred.

## Study Plan
Day 1:

- Install Wireshark: Download and install Wireshark on your computer. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with the interface.

- Learn the basics of networking: Before jumping into Wireshark, it's important to have a basic understanding of networking concepts. Spend some time learning about the OSI model, TCP/IP protocol suite, and common network topologies.

- Capture your first packet: Capture your first packet with Wireshark. Start by capturing some simple network traffic on your own computer or network.

- Analyze captured packets: Analyze the packets you have captured in Wireshark. Start by looking at the headers and understanding what information they contain.

Day 2:

- Filter packets: Learn how to filter packets in Wireshark. Filtering allows you to isolate specific traffic and focus on analyzing it.

- Use Wireshark display filters: Wireshark has a powerful display filtering system that allows you to filter packets based on various criteria. Spend some time learning how to use display filters.

- Understand common protocols: Spend some time learning about common protocols such as HTTP, DNS, TCP, and UDP. This will help you understand the traffic you are capturing.

- Practice analyzing traffic: Spend the second day practicing your Wireshark skills by capturing traffic on your own network and analyzing it. Try to identify different types of traffic and understand the different protocols being used.

Day 3:

- Learn advanced features: Once you have a basic understanding of Wireshark, start exploring some of the more advanced features like packet decryption, protocol analysis, and statistical analysis.

- Join online communities: Join online communities like Wireshark's official forum and Stack Exchange's Network Engineering forum. These communities can help you learn from others and get answers to your questions.

- Take an online course: Consider taking an online course on Wireshark. There are many courses available on platforms like Udemy, Pluralsight, and LinkedIn Learning that can help you develop your skills quickly.

- Practice regularly: Wireshark is a powerful tool, and the more you use it, the better you will become. Try to practice regularly by capturing and analyzing traffic on your own network.
